Dr. Ma discussed with me about this paper, and I really learned a lot from this discussion. I hope I 
can do better in the future. Followings are some advice from him.

- The criterion used to evaluate the model should change from MAE to MSE.
- The meaning of Z in the equation system is not clear.
- It's not about prediction, but estimation.
- The reason why define a critical lane is not clear.
- Should understand concepts of *Weaving*, *lane changing*, and *car following*.
- This topic can be extended to research the relationship between lane mean speed and car following 
behavior as well as lane changing behavior. And if I'm interested in it, I can take it as the topic of 
my **Master Thesis**. About the this topic, there is a very typical model called *second-order model*. I 
should read some papers related to this topic.
- This paper only consider the spatial relationship, the improvement should be considering the temporal 
relationship at the same time.
- Unlike the traditional car following models and lane changing models which use **physis** to model the 
traffic flow, if we want to research the relationships between lane mean speed and the aforementioned 
two bahaviors, our model is **data-driven** model.
